Pinecards structure
===================

As ``pinefarm`` acts as interface, the configuration of the
external program differs largely.
While the specific details discussed on the dedicated pages,
there are two common files:

- The :doc:`metadata.txt <metadata>` file (optional).
- The :doc:`postrun.sh <postrun>` file (optional, must be executable).
